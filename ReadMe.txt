This repository contains data from Sentinel-2 captured over Amery Ice Shelf, and jupyter notebooks that perform POD/PCA analysis followed by K-means clustering on that data. 

The main jupyter notebook to explore is POD_PCA_Sentinel2_Amery, and it is available in a Binder which can be accessed using this link:

The processing_data notebook has already been run and writes the .csv files for each band of Sentinel-2 data, which are subsequently opened by POD_PCA_Sentinel2_Amery.ipynb.
